Advanced Face Recognition App with Facial Analysis
Designed and implemented a face recognition model with additional features to analyze facial expressions and detect multiple faces.
Developed algorithms to calculate smile percentage and detect the state (open/closed) of left and right eyes.
Integrated these features into the mobile app, providing real-time feedback on the number of faces, smile percentage, and eye openness.
